/**
 * @mainpage A generic frontend for 3D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
 * 
 * @section sec_motiv Motivation
 * 
 * This library provides a frontend for a graph-based SLAM in three dimensional space.
 * It does not provide a graph-optimization-backend itself (often referred to as SLAM).
 * Instead different backends can be used by implementing the Solver-Interface.
 * 
 * @section sec_start Getting started
 * 
 * The central component of this library is the GraphMapper class.
 * The documentation is best read by starting from there.
 * This class is extended by registering Sensor modules, an Odometry and a Solver.
 * 
 * @section sec_example Programming example
 * 
 * Start by creating the mapper itself and registering the required modules.
 @code
#include <slam3d/GraphMapper.hpp> 
#include <slam3d/G2oSolver.hpp>

using namespace slam3d;
Clock* clock = new Clock();
Logger* logger = new Logger(*c);
GraphMapper* mapper = new GraphMapper(logger);

Sensor* laser = new PointCloudSensor("laser", logger, Transform::Identity());
mapper->registerSensor(laser);

G2oSolver* g2o = new G2oSolver(logger);
mapper->setSolver(g2o);
 @endcode
 * Within the callback of your sensor data, add the new measurements to the mapper.
 @code
Measurement m* = new PointCloudMeasurement(cloud, "my_robot", laser->getName(), laser->getSensorPose());
if(!mapper->addReading(m))
{
  delete m;

	 * @class GraphMapper
	 * @brief Holds measurements from different sensors in a graph.
	 * @details The GraphMapper is the central structure that provides the
	 * frontend for a graph-based SLAM approach. A registered Sensor
	 * will provide a specific Measurement type to the internal graph.
	 * For each added measurement a new vertex is created in the graph
	 * that holds a pointer to the measurement together with the measurement's
	 * pose in the map coordinate frame. This data is stored in a VertexObject.
	 * 
	 * Spatial relations between measurements are represented as edges in the
	 * graph. A registered Odometry will provide spatial constraints between any
	 * kind of consecutive measurements. Each sensor can create constraints
	 * between its own measurements by applying some kind of matching algoithm.
	 * This kind of 6 DoF spatial relation is stored as transform and covariance
	 * within an EdgeObject.
	 * 
	 * The global optimization is provided by a Solver that takes the internal
	 * nodes and edges (without the measurements) and solves the SLAM problem by
	 * applying a graph optimization algorithm. This will usually change the
	 * poses of all nodes in the map coordinate frame.
